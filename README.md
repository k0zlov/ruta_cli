# Ruta CLI

The Ruta CLI is a command-line tool for the Ruta framework, inspired
by [dart_frog](https://github.com/VeryGoodOpenSource/dart_frog). It simplifies the process of building and running Ruta
servers by providing a set of convenient commands.

## Features

- **Build Command**: Generate your server code using `build_runner`.
- **Run Command**: Build and start your Ruta server in one step.
- **Extensible**: Easily add new commands to fit your workflow.

## Installation

Add the CLI to your machine:

```bash
dart pub global activate ruta_cli
